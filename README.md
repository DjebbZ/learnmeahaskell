# Learn me a Haskell

As I want to understand functional programming, I decided I should learn Haskell, the "pure functional programming language".

I found [Learn you a Haskell](http://learnyouahaskell.com), a nice and free introduction to the language. This repo is basically my playground as I follow the book.

I hope I'll find it useful, fun and interesting !

## Usage

1. Install the [Haskell Platform](http://www.haskell.org/platform/)
